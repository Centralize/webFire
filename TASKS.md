# webFire: Task List

This document outlines the tasks required for the development of webFire.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Foundation

*   [x] Initialize Git repository
*   [x] Create project structure (backend, frontend, docs)
*   [x] Setup virtual environment for Python
*   [x] Install initial dependencies (FastAPI, uvicorn)
*   [x] Create initial `main.py` for the FastAPI application
*   [x] Choose and initialize a frontend framework (e.g., Vue.js with Vite)

## Phase 2: Backend Development (API)

*   [x] **UFW Integration:**
    *   [x] Research and choose a Python library for UFW interaction (e.g., `python-ufw`, or using `subprocess`) - Decided to use the `subprocess` module for direct control.
    *   [x] Implement a service to get UFW status
    *   [x] Implement a service to list all UFW rules
    *   [x] Implement a service to add a new UFW rule
    *   [x] Implement a service to delete a UFW rule
    *   [x] Implement a service to enable/disable UFW
*   [x] **API Endpoints:**
    *   [x] Create API endpoint to get UFW status (`/api/status`)
    *   [x] Create API endpoint to get all rules (`/api/rules`)
    *   [x] Create API endpoint to add a rule (`/api/rules`) - POST
    *   [x] Create API endpoint to delete a rule (`/api/rules/{rule_id}`) - DELETE
    *   [x] Create API endpoint to enable UFW (`/api/enable`) - POST
    *   [x] Create API endpoint to disable UFW (`/api/disable`) - POST
*   [x] **API Security:**
    *   [x] Implement input validation for all endpoints
    *   [x] Implement authentication and authorization (e.g., JWT-based)
    *   [x] Add CORS middleware
*   [x] **Testing:**
    *   [x] Set up pytest for backend testing
    *   [x] Write unit tests for UFW services
    *   [x] Write integration tests for API endpoints

## Phase 3: Frontend Development (UI)

*   [x] **Core Components:**
    *   [x] Create a main layout component
    *   [x] Create a navigation bar
    *   [x] Create a footer component
*   [x] **Dashboard/Status Page:**
    *   [x] Display UFW status (enabled/disabled)
    *   [x] Create a component to display a summary of rules
*   [x] **Rules Management Page:**
    *   [x] Create a table to display all UFW rules
    *   [x] Implement functionality to add a new rule via a form/modal
    *   [x] Implement functionality to delete a rule
    *   [x] Add filtering and searching for rules
*   [x] **Settings Page:**
    *   [x] Add controls to enable/disable UFW
*   [x] **API Integration:**
    *   [x] Connect frontend components to the backend API
    *   [x] Implement state management (e.g., Pinia for Vue.js)
*   [x] **Styling:**
    *   [x] Choose and integrate a CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS)
    *   [x] Ensure a responsive and mobile-friendly design

## Phase 4: Deployment and Security

*   [x] **Containerization:**
    *   [x] Create a `Dockerfile` for the backend application
    *   [x] Create a `Dockerfile` for the frontend application
    *   [x] Create a `docker-compose.yml` to run both services together
*   [x] **Web Server:**
    *   [x] Configure a web server (e.g., Nginx) to serve the frontend and proxy API requests
*   [x] **Security Hardening:**
    *   [x] Review and apply security best practices for FastAPI
    *   [x] Secure the application with HTTPS (e.g., using Let's Encrypt)
    *   [x] Set up logging and monitoring

## Phase 5: Documentation

*   [x] **User Documentation:**
    *   [x] Write a user guide on how to use webFire
    *   [x] Document the installation and setup process
*   [x] **API Documentation:**
    *   [x] Generate and refine OpenAPI documentation for the API
*   [x] **Developer Documentation:**
    *   [x] Add comments to the code where necessary
    *   [x] Create a `README.md` with instructions for developers
